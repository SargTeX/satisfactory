# Satisfactory

This document shall help us planning our factories in a _satisfactory_ way.

**Sectors** are different parts of the map that have been restricted to a single purpose. For example, one sector could be the _production of Iron Plates_, another one the _production of Iron Rods_, one could be the *Central HUB*.

**Logistics** describe different ways of transportation, as well as organization of these transports. For example, a cross-sector Main Bus could be part of logistics, but also an inner-sector Conveyor Belt organization could be part of logistics.

## Sectors

### Central HUB

Status: Idea

The Central HUB contains storages for each resource produced, including buffers. It allows _players_ fast access to the resources for construction or to fill the Space Elevator.

Not allowed:
 - **Automated resource removal**: The Central HUB is the final end for the resource chain; therefore, no resources should be automatically removed (except for research/tier unlocking such as through the space elevator); this way, even while underproducing e.g. iron plates, the player still has the opportunity to access the iron plates produced before hitting the underproduction

Located buildings:
 - [The HUB](https://satisfactory.gamepedia.com/The_HUB)
 - [Storage Containers](https://satisfactory.gamepedia.com/Storage_Container) (May be Mk.2?)
 - [Space Elevator](https://satisfactory.gamepedia.com/Space_Elevator)


## Logistics

### Main Bus

Status: Idea

The Main Bus is a unified transportation system on that every single resource produced in the game is being shipped at least once.

Traditionally, main buses consist out of [Conveyor Belts](https://satisfactory.gamepedia.com/Conveyor_Belt) (see main bus designs from Factorio). But if the take-off of resources is less frequent, e.g. only once per sector, a Main Bus could also be realized using [Trains](https://satisfactory.gamepedia.com/Electric_Locomotive).

An efficient potential use-case for a Main Bus could be in a growing factory, where each **Sector** receives a buffer-storage for each resource. Then, all resources necessary for the expansion of the sector (or a potential remodelling/updating to higher tiers) would be available on-spot and would not have to be transported by the _player_ manually, overcoming theoratically all inventory limitations of [Trucks](https://satisfactory.gamepedia.com/Truck) (48 slots) and [player Inventories](https://satisfactory.gamepedia.com/Inventory) (68 slots).
