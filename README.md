# Satisfactory

This document shall help us planning our factories in a _satisfactory_ way.

**Sectors** are different parts of the map that have been restricted to a single purpose. For example, one sector could be the _production of Iron Plates_, another one the _production of Iron Rods_, one could be the *Central HUB*.

**Logistics** describe different ways of transportation, as well as organization of these transports. For example, a cross-sector Main Bus could be part of logistics, but also an inner-sector Conveyor Belt organization could be part of logistics.

## Sectors

### Central HUB

The Central HUB contains storages for each resource produced, including buffers. It allows _players_ fast access to the resources for construction or to fill the Space Elevator.

Not allowed:
 - **Automated resource removal**: The Central HUB is the final end for the resource chain; therefore, no resources should be automatically removed (except for research/tier unlocking such as through the space elevator); this way, even while underproducing e.g. iron plates, the player still has the opportunity to access the iron plates produced before hitting the underproduction
